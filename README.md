# CCN January 2023 Workshop

Materials for the workshop on CaImAn and Mesmerize for Calcium & Voltage Imaging.

This workshop will cover the following topics:

1. [`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib) for very fast interactive visualization of large datasets in notebooks.
2. Preprocessing of calcium imaging data
3. Various [`CaImAn`] algorithms including:
  - NoRMCorre motion correction
  - CNMF(E) - Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for source separation and extraction
  - OnACID and FIOLA for online calcium imaging analysis
  - VolPy for voltage imaging analysis
4. `mesmerize-core` for parameter optimization and dataorganization of CaImAn algorithm outputs.
5. Postprocessing
